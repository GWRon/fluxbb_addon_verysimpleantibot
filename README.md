# VerySimpleAntiBot

An addon for the bulletin board software __Fluxbb__.

## Requirements

Requires Fluxbb v1.5.8+ because it utilizes the newly introduced hook system to ease the integration process.

VerySimpleAntiBot does __not__ require JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Open the language files in `langs` and edit the questions contained in the file `YOURLANG/addon_verysimpleantibot.php`. It is possible to use individual questions for each language. This allows pun/website specific questions to increase difficulty for foreign spammers.

2. Upload `plugins/AP_VerySimpleAntiBot.php`.
3. Upload `addons/verysimpleantibot.php`.
4. Upload the individual language files of the language directory `lang`

## Configuration

To configure the addon, head to your boards admin panel and
click on "VerySimpleAntiBot" located under "Plugins" in the menu on the
the left hand of the page.

Activate the module for the parts you want to get "protected" and press
"Save".
